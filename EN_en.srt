5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Marty ! Doc !

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,210
What happened to the DeLorean ?

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,150
Remember, at the end of BTTF 3 it was crushed by a train?

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,100
What happened to the DeLorean ?

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,239
It didn't pass technical inspection anymore.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,430

11
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,790
This one can drive up to 120 km.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,530

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,670
it's way enough when one travels...in time !

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:54,170
But, why this outfit?

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,430
Oh damn, you're right!

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,290
Marty, we have to fix the future !

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,320
Future? What's up with the future ?

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm just back from the year 2042.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,210
Earth has been devastated...

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,259
by nuclear weapons.
What?

21
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,369
Yes, it is a technical bug

22
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,890
in computer chips.

23
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,869
The bug allowed North Korea to hack into

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,830
the Chinese nuclear system

25
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:18,320
(Which, by the way, was still running a pirated Windows XP).

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:20,539
In 2022, Earth went BOOM!

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,200
In 2022, Trump (just being re-elected) decided to hit back.

28
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,530
And POW! ...

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,070
Anyway, there's nothing left.

30
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,869
What can we do?

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,429
We need to fix this problem in the original source.

32
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,220
We need to prevent this bug from being introduced in processors.

33
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:33,950
How?

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,259
This bug was introduced in 1988.

35
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,820
In 1988!?

36
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:39,829
Yes, due to backward compatibility.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,329
This implementation detail

38
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,820
is still present in 2022's CPUs.

39
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,049
The hardware architect, who introduced the bug by mistake,

40
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,119
was working on this project

41
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,009
Way back in 1988.

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,740
and this is the year we need to go back to.
You're the doc, Doc.

43
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,210
Where can we find this "architect"?

44
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,799
He gave a lecture at BreizhCamp,

45
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,780
not far away from us.

46
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,100
Hum, not far in space, but

47
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,750
in time it was 30 years ago.

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,680
Anyway, distances

49
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,490
in the space-time continuum

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,799
are very abstract concepts.

51
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,890
As you say so, Doc.

52
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,950
Let’s not spend any more time. Let’s go!

53
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:13,010
Put on these 80's clothes so we fit in. I’ll remove this.

54
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,269
Hurry up!

55
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,750
We don't need to hurry, actually...

56
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:20,870
But not doing so, would make this movie so boring!

57
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,090
The space-time converter will

58
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,890
get us back to 1988. I'm configuring our arrival

59
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,069
for the first day of that 1988 BreizhCamp conference.

60
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,819
We will arrive on March 28th 1988.

61
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,500
Let's put on our seatbelts!

62
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,120
No need for security, Marty!

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:48,790
where we we go, we don't need to be root!
(road "route" in french == "root")

64
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:50,510
Hello!

65
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,680
Can I take your names for badges?

66
00:02:50,510 --> 00:03:01,970
Mar...
He's Mark Zuckerberg! and I'm Linus Torvalds.

67
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:03,280
Ok, 50 francs please, for entrance.

68
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:10,310
Oops, seems I made a mistake with your name.
Never mind.

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,420
How exciting, isn't it ?

70
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,349
Let's check this session,

71
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,590
we'll be here in two minutes.

72
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:18,530
WOW, that's high definition!

73
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,859
Yes indeed, it's Super VGA,

74
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,750
up to 1024x768 with 16 colours.

75
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:26,959
It's a perfect match for a graphics workstation.

76
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,290
Is it free?
Hum, not really...

77
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,000
Hello sir!

78
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,350
Are you a developer?
What?

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,209
Do you know our development environment?

80
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,010
DosDEV.

81
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,709
It's a highly productive environnement,

82
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,610
up to 10 times faster

83
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,740
than what you've been used to.

84
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,140
I’ll give you the brochure.

85
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,160
Don't hesitate to give it a try.

86
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:55,290
OMG, one did crazy things in 80's.

87
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:57,450
F***, this game is a piece of shit!

88
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,970
Seems they were drunk or drugged when coding it!

89
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:08,459
I'll go crazy trying to use it,

90
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:09,740
or maybe become an angry video game nerd?

91
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,790
McFly !!!
Did you fix the Street Fighter arcade in the cafeteria?

92
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,110
Not yet Biff, that's a complex job you know ...

93
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,760
as you threw Coke on it...

94
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,140
And how do you expect me

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,060
to train for the challenge

96
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:24,000
if you don't fix the arcade?
I'll do it today, I promise.

97
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,800
... Dad is a Nerd!
Hey Marty, there you are.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,540
Sorry for that, would prefer you don't see him.

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,060
But you know, in 2018,

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,770
being a geek will be cool...surprisingly.

101
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,280
If you say so, Doc.
Let's go!

102
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,260
... and with the new memory model

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,220
and unified cache we will get

104
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,610
80x386 architecture way beyond

105
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:54,000
it's initial capacity.

106
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:55,890
We get execution speed almost doubled!

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,410
Come and ask him questions, to distract him,

108
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,880
while I'm fixing his documents.

109
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,680
Hello, interesting lecture. I wonder ...

110
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,950
how far will you get this new generation?

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,110
What's its execution frequency?

112
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:11,190
25 MHz! And we even have a 33 MHz prototype in the lab.

113
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,490
Interesting...

114
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,360
And with 8 ko integrated cache,

115
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,250
and a 32 bit communication bus,

116
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,110
we will have access to huge resources!

117
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,520
Imagine:

118
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,140
We could even go beyond the 640k limit! :)

119
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,880
but...what about heat?

120
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,220
You're right, with incredibly fine engraving

121
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,560
at only 1 micron, this becomes an issue.

122
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,860
We are looking for workarounds.

123
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:41,840
Maybe we will need a heat dissipator.
Oh right, thanks.

124
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,090
I'm done Marty, we can leave.

125
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,590
McFly, McFly what the hell are you doing. Learn programming?

126
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,000
You’re not fixing the Arcade?

127
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,539
But you know ...

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,550
I hope we haven't altered the space-time continuum.

129
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,289
Hello, hello, anybody home?
Think, McFly. Think!

130
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,430
Do you realize what will happen,

131
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,870
if I start the challenge

132
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,580
without being trained enough? Want me to be a loser?

133
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,650
Want me to be look like an idiot during the challenge?

134
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,909
Is that what you're looking for?
Of course not, Biff.

135
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,430
No, I wouldn't want that to happen.

136
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:07,490
Hey sir, you left this on the floor.

137
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,279
Oh thanks.
Great game, you'll  have lots of fun with it.

138
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,810
Hey McFly, I'll train with this one, while

139
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,240
I wait for you to fix the arcade.

140
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,699

141
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,639
I'll work on it first thing tomorrow, alright?

142
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:22,810
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied.

143
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,810
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

144
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,380
Tell me Doc, this Intel Architect

145
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:36,710
How did you know he was speaking at BreizhCamp?
Marty,

146
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:38,030
All the best speakers come to BreizhCamp!
